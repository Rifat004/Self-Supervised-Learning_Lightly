# Self-Supervised-Learning_Lightly

This repository implements a semi-supervised learning (SSL) pipeline using PyTorch lightning, Lightly, and SimCLR model, focusing on SSL techniques. The setup includes various backbone networks for feature extraction and a SimCLR-based architecture with an NTXent loss function for training. The data folder structure follows class-based subfolders, enhancing SSL compatibility. The pipeline facilitates model training, evaluation using kNN for learned representations, and accuracy assessment. Accuracy can be improved further through more training.

Key insights :
- How to create a SimCLR model
- How to generate image representations
